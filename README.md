# Anka, the Anki with a-


Anka is a Flashcard app designed with the intention of making it easier to learn new languages, on the go or otherwise. This project was inspired from Anki and its lack of a slick and clean User Interface (but without the SM2 algorithm...unless? ðŸ‘€)

- Sliiiiiiiiick UI
- Login online using any device! (mobile view to be improved)
- still has Flashcards!!! WOW!!
- Most importantly, DARK MODE TOGGLE! (u hv 2 click on the duck)
- Other unimplemented stuff:
  - Decks and Language Sets
  - Testing system
  - Notes to complement your decks
  - Profile and stats
  - ...
  
~~This totally isn't just a random excuse to build my first TypeScript fullstack app. Nope absolutely not.~~


<h1> Anki means memorization in Japanese (æš—è¨˜), but do you know that Anka meansðŸ¦†DuckðŸ¦†inðŸ¦†Swedish?ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦† </h1>

This is a WIP! Unfortunately I have decided to leave the backend repo private as of now, so this repo is unusable. Check out this cool login page in the meantime!
